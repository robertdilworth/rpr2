Please play the part of software developer and ask me questions so that you have the necessary information to determine requirements and how to build the app that I would like.  
I am a portfolio manager and I want to build a web based app that will be used for portfolio construction, analysis and management.  
But first I want to focus on a bare bones then develop from there.  
For bare bones, I want to have a header, with a placeholder for my logo on the left, and on the right text that says either Login or Logout depending, 
and to the right of that a placeholder for my profile image.  the profile image will contain links to settings etc.  
The main page can be blank for now, and maybe just have simple placeholder text of 'RPR' centered both horizontally and vertically.   
When I click on Login, I want a page to open under the header that to have a header of "Login" centered and below that email address, and below that password, and below that a button to "Login".   
Below that I would like a button that allows login with Google.  and below that a link  that says 'Register" which will take you to a new page to allow you to register.  
I want the Login page to look nice.   I want the registration page to have a similar appearance to the Login page. 
As well, I want to use google to send a verification email to the person signing up.  
After they sign up and verify their email. I want them to be taken to a page that offers 3 different offers - Bronze, Silver, Gold.  Each one will have a monthly subscription price attached to it. 
They will need to buy a package, then they will have access to the services offered.  This will use stripe as the payment system attached. 

After you have asked me a series of questions to comprehend the system to be developed, please write out a summary of the app and the requirements needed, and then a process to develop.
