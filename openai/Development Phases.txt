Initialize the Backend

Set up Django project and create a new app for user authentication.
Configure the database (likely PostgreSQL for production).
Initialize the Frontend

Create a React app using Create React App or a template.
Set up project structure, including folders for components, assets, etc.
User Authentication

Implement basic registration and login using Django.
Add Google OAuth for alternative login and registration.
Implement email verification for new users.
Phase 2: UI/UX and Frontend Features
Design the Header

Implement a header with placeholders for the logo and profile image.
Main Page Design

Center the placeholder text 'RPR' on the main page.
Login and Registration Pages

Design and implement aesthetically pleasing login and registration pages.
Phase 3: Subscription and Payment System
Subscription Plans

Design the layout for Bronze, Silver, and Gold plans.
Implement Stripe API for payment.
Failed Payment and Renewal

Implement logic for dealing with failed payments and renewals.
Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
Unit Testing

Write unit tests for the backend and frontend features.
Deployment

Prepare the app for deployment to a Debian 12 server.
Set up server configurations, including the database and web server.
Phase 5: Future Work
Analytics & Portfolio Management

Features will be decided later but could include portfolio models, Yahoo Finance integration, and portfolio optimization.
Additional Security Measures

Implement features like two-factor authentication.
You can use VSCode for development; it's a solid choice for both Django and React development. 
You already have a Debian 12 server for production, which is excellent for running a Django app securely and efficiently.
